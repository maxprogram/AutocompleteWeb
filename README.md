# Full-stack web autocomplete project

- GOAL: Create a small web app with a text box that autocompletes when you start typing in it. (This should look similar to how it's done when you search on Google.)
- The dictionary of 61,000 words is in the repo (`words.json`).
- The app will need a front-end but design is not a focus here -- you're welcome to use whatever front-end library to accomplish the selection as you need. But otherwise as long as it works it doesn't matter how it looks.
- The back-end can be in any language you choose.
- There should be server-side 1 endpoint that the front-end calls that provides the autocomplete words -- but the assumption here is that there could be 10M words and therefore you can't download them all. Just however many you need from the server at a time.
